Knowledge representation and modeling is a key area in artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on how to formally represent information about the world in a way that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks, such as reasoning, decision-making, and learning. It is the foundation for systems like expert systems, natural language processing, and autonomous robots.
